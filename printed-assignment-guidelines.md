## Printed Assignment Guidelines

As with all written work, proofread for spelling and grammar. This is where working as a team will come in handy.

Any printed work that you will turn in, should always contain the following:

* Date
* Your first and last name
* Climate & Design
* Spring 2019
* Diaz, Kruczkiewicz
